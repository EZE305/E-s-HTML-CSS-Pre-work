            <h1>Background</h1>
            <strong id="weed"><small>A Story Involving Weed...</small> </strong>
            <p id="background-p" class="story-p">Growing up in Miami I had difficulty finding something that I was passionate about. Something that I found interested that also allowed me to make a comfortable living. 
                3.5 years into a business degree I saw headlines on the news about the "Green Rush" happening in places like Colorado and California. I was strongly driven to learn as much 
                about the newly booming legal cannabis market. I changed my course of study to Agriculture Science and attempted to apply everything I learned to cannabis. I developed technical
                lab skills working in the Microbiology lab and learned how to grow plants/food while managing the Organic Garden at my university. All this knowledge was directly applied into 
                developing a career in cannabis. This was 6 years ago and through this journey I've grown indoors and outdoors, mixed light and in greenhouses. I realized my degree was being underutilized
                and switched to working in a lab setting where I learned how to make medical grade extracts. This led me to a company making recreational extracts and with my background I was able to
                climb up the ladder eventually becoming the lab director for a small company. Over the last 2 years the green rush has drastically died down. Even the biggest brands and largest names
                are having difficulty making money regardless of the quality of the product. I decided to diversify my skill set and get into a more secure and lucrative industry that would also allow 
                for more autonomy in terms of workspace and salary as cannabis scientists are severely underpaid and underappreciated. I started this coding bootcamp just a month before being let go due to
                a steady decline in sales. Now I strive to develop my career in tech and through the learning process find exactly where in this industry I best fit in.

            <p id="motivation-p" class="story-p">Maturing and gaining perspective has allowed for a re-prioritization of what is important, and what life really is about. 
                Starting 2022 I found myself alone in California after pursuing a dream. Proud of all that I had achieved, but feeling 
                an emptiness brought upon being so far from my family and friends I left in Miami 5 years ago. Never truly feeling at home in the 
                Bay Area, I reflected on the time I was happiest. It was a time I was also the busiest I had ever been, but surrounded by friends
                and loved ones. This sparked an intense urge to travel as many places as I could. I thankfully had important people by my side 
                which made it all worthwhile. Being able to work from anywhere became a top priority this past year in pursuing a new career along with earning 
                enough to make a decent living.

            <h1>What I like to do</h1>
            <strong id="hobbysmall"><small>Hobbies and Such</small> </strong>
            <p id="hobbies" class= "story-p"> My whole life I've been a musician. I play trumpet, produce music and like to mess around 
                on all sorts of percussive and wind instruments. Most of my friends are also musicians and most of those same friends are
                are also in the tech industry. I enjoy exercising and spending time in nature as well as playing sports. I specialize in sports
                that some may not even consider sports like Frisbee and Pickleball. I enjoy myself a strong cup of coffee and will go out of my way to 
                make someone a good cup of coffee (Cuban Espresso to be exact, made Colada style). I love cooking and making simple things taste amazing. 
                I love spending time with friends and sharing stories. I'm really a simple person, but all the things I like to do, I like to do them well.

            <strong>As I develop more and more skills in this industry, I am sure I will learn how and where I would like to apply them. As of this moment I am unsure
